# Transfer Learning: Flower Data Set

Project code for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree program. In this project, I developed code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then converted it into a command line application.

Training used 102 different types of flowers, where there ~20 images per flower to train on. The trained classifier can be used to predict the flower type for new images of flowers.
